I was thinking about the project idea, and here's my idea for the network:
Essentially: the blockchain is a map of domain names to public keys
If you want to run a website, you run a "full" node
if you just want to figure out website's pubkeys, you run a half node that just watches the gossip on the network.
so, you own a domain name, i.e. google.com.
In order to keep it, occasionally, you need to answer challenges, to prove you still own the domain.
a challenge is minted by the network, and will have the format:
"When you go to https://google.com/challenge.html , display the string "6dcba183f784ba3acdfae14ae2131ac6ee3c144b43a14e1270cad0e68c517bcb". 
(google announces its public key when it joins the network, this pubkey is verified by the challenge)
the people who verify that the challenge was completed are other websites (full nodes) e.g. reddit.com, paypal.com, sketchy_random_website.com, ...
these people are elected by the network, based on some criterion (not sure what???)
How we test it: On the 406 lab computers ðŸ˜ˆ
The ppl that verify the challenge sign google's pubkey, which allows firefox (for example) to use that ca-certificate.
